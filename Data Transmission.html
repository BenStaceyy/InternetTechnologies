    <title> Data Transmission </title>
    <h1>Data Transmission</h3>
    <p>Data transmission refers to the process of sending data from one digital device to another </p>
    <h2>Interference</h2>
    <p>Disturbances in this process are called Interferences they prevent sucsessfull transmissions of data this can be caused by a number of different problems from the Thickness of your wall to other Networks</p>
    <h2>Parallel vs Serial</h2>
    <p>There are a number of methods used for transferring data between computers. You will need to be able to distinguish between Serial Transmission and Parallel Transmission. </p>
    <h2>Serial</h2>
    <p>Serial Data Transmission uses a single wire to transmit the data. A single wire is inexpensive and can transmit over long distances. The bits are transmitted sequentially, one bit at a time. There is a set time interval between each bit.</p>
    <h2>Parallel</h2>
    <p>Parallel Data Transmission uses multiple wires to transfer the data bits simultaneously. Eight wires could transmit 1 byte all at once. Parallel transmission can occur faster but it needs more wires and it is more expensive. More errors as well.</p>
    <h2>Simplex</h2>
    <p>In simplex transmission, the communication is one directional, like a one-way street. Only one of the two devices on a link can transmit, the other can only receive. The simplex transmission can use the entire capacity of the channel to send data in one direction. 
    Example: Keyboard and traditional monitors. The keyboard can only introduce input, the monitor can only give the output.</p>
    <h2>Duplex</h2>
    <p>In duplex transmission, both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously. In duplex mode, signals going in one direction share the capacity of the link with signals going in another direction, this sharing can occur in two ways: 
        Either the link must contain two physically separate transmission paths, one for sending and the other for receiving.
        Or the capacity is divided between signals travelling in both directions.
        Duplex transmission is used when communication in both directions is required all the time. The capacity of the channel, however, must be divided between the two directions. 
        
        Example: Telephone Network in which there is communication between two persons by a telephone line, through which both can talk and listen at the same time. </p>
